 ## UX

<a name="ux"></a>

### Pre-project planning
When deciding on the project, I evaluated the examples given through course content. Quizes are not something that I do quite often and there are a lot of trends website out there. I settled on rock paper scissors lizard spock game as it stood out to me as it is something different, and upon more researched there are not many games out there.
I then decided to do rock paper scissors lizard spock game with a big bang theory twist on it as I'm a huge fan of the show.

## UX Design

### To identify the best way forward for my project, I started looking at the user and business requirements for this type of game

> As a player I want to understand the rules of the game

> As a player I want to be able to pick my character

> As a player I want to be able to keep score

> As a player I want to be able to leave feedback if I like it or have an idea for improvement


## Owner

> As an owner I need to provide rules of the game

> As an owner I need to provide character selection options

> As an owner I need to provide a score area

> As an owner I need to provide a feedback form

## Scope Pane

> Website should have consistent navigation layout

> Website should have a header clearly indicating the game

> Website should contain rules section

> Website should contain character selection dropdown

> Website should contain game area

> Website should contain hand choice for the player

> Website should contain feedback form

## Structure Pane

> Website will contain 2 pages: Main page for the game and feedback form page
